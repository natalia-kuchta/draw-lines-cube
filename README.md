# Three.js Cube and Lines Project

This project demonstrates the use of Three.js to create a 3D scene containing a rotating cube and two lines passing through the cube. The project uses basic Three.js components including geometries, materials, and animations.

```
Scene: A 3D scene is created using Three.js.

Camera: A perspective camera is set up to view the scene.

Renderer: A WebGL renderer is used to render the scene and camera.

Cube: A rotating cube is added to the scene.

Lines: Two lines, each with different colors, are added to the scene and intersect the cube.
